### 1.Getting Started
Load jQuery(3+) and include Owl Carousel plugin files

add to your Gemfile
```ruby
gem 'owlcarousel-rails'
```

add to your application.js
```ruby
//= require owl.carousel
```

add to your application.css
```ruby
*= require owl.carousel
*= require owl.theme
```

### 2.Set up your HTML
You don't need any special markup. All you need is to wrap your divs inside the container element <div class="owl-carousel">. Class "owl-carousel" is mandatory to apply proper styles that come from owl.carousel.css file.

```html
<div class="owl-carousel">
  <div> Your Content </div>
  <div> Your Content </div>
  <div> Your Content </div>
  <div> Your Content </div>
  <div> Your Content </div>
  <div> Your Content </div>
  <div> Your Content </div>
  ...
</div>
```
### 3.Call the plugin
Now call the Owl initializer function and your carousel is ready.

```html
$(".owl-carousel").owlCarousel();
```
